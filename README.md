# AWS-DEEPRACERS-REWARD-FUNCTION
Myself Vivek Kaushik, An enthusiast software developer from VIT Bhopal University currently pursing B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering with specialization in Cloud Computing and Automation.

The Project I worked on is AWS Deepracers in which I had to create a reward function for the vehicle to run on the track and when the vehicle is moving correctly on the track we give it a reward and for going outside the track we need to punish it to correct it. We had to finsh the complete track within a given period of time(i.e 3 min) to qualify for the next level.
